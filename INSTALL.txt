KD SOAP 1.x requires a Qt version >= 4.6 with Network and XML support enabled.

0) From the top directory of your KD SOAP installation run the "configure" scripts.

   On Windows use depending on the kind of build on one of the following;
     configure.bat -shared -debug
     configure.bat -shared -release
     configure.bat -static -debug
     configure.bat -static -release

   On Unix use depending on the kind of build on one of the following;
     ./configure.sh -shared -debug
     ./configure.sh -shared -release
     ./configure.sh -static -debug
     ./configure.sh -static -release

   To define the install-location use for example;
     configure.bat -shared -debug -prefix c:/kdsoap
     ./configure.sh -shared -debug -prefix /opt/kdsoap


1) Unix

set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to your KD SOAP installation lib directory.

If you do not have LD_LIBRARY_PATH set already then use this line:
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/kdsoap/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

The above has to be added into your .bashrc or similar to remain. It may also of course be run from a shell just before building software using KD SOAP, but in this case your settings will only be available for this shell.

2) MacOS
Proceed as described above, but using DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH instead
of LD_LIBRARY_PATH

3) Windows
Add the path to KD SOAP lib into your LIB environment variable and the path
to KD SOAP bin into your PATH environment variable.

Or run:
set PATH=\path\to\kdsoap\bin;%PATH%
set LIB=\path\to\kdsoap\lib;%LIB%


4) Build everything by typing:

make    # Unix,
nmake   # Windows


5) (optionally:) Install KD SOAP:

   From your top-level KD SOAP directory just type

make install   # Unix,
nmake install  # Windows

   This will copy the necessary files into the sub-directories of
   your installation path:
   For Unix/Linux, Mac: /usr/local/KDAB/KDSoap-VERSION/
   For Windows that is: C:\KDAB\KDSoap-VERSION\


6) Have a look at the examples applications. They will get you started with KD SOAP 1.x.

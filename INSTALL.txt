KD SOAP 1.x requires a Qt version >= 4.6 with Network and XML support enabled.

0) From the top directory of your KD SOAP installation run the "configure" scripts.

   On Windows use depending on the kind of build one of the following;
     configure.bat -shared -debug
     configure.bat -shared -release

   On Unix use depending on the kind of build one of the following;
     ./configure.sh -shared -debug
     ./configure.sh -shared -release

   To define the install-location use for example;
     configure.bat -shared -debug -prefix c:/kdsoap
     ./configure.sh -shared -debug -prefix /opt/kdsoap


1) Unix

set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to your KD SOAP installation lib directory.

If you do not have LD_LIBRARY_PATH set already then use this line:
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/kdsoap/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

The above has to be added into your .bashrc or similar to remain. It may also of course be run from a shell just before building software using KD SOAP, but in this case your settings will only be available for this shell.

2) MacOS

Proceed as described above, but using DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH instead
of LD_LIBRARY_PATH

3) Windows

Add the path to KD SOAP lib into your LIB environment variable and the path
to KD SOAP bin into your PATH environment variable.

Or run:
set PATH=\path\to\kdsoap\bin;%PATH%
set LIB=\path\to\kdsoap\lib;%LIB%


4) Build everything by typing:

make    # Unix,
nmake   # Windows


5) (optionally:) Install KD SOAP:

   From your top-level KD SOAP directory just type

make install   # Unix,
nmake install  # Windows

   This will copy the necessary files into the sub-directories of
   your installation path:
   For Unix/Linux, Mac: /usr/local/KDAB/KDSoap-VERSION/
   For Windows that is: C:\KDAB\KDSoap-VERSION\


6) Symbian

Here is a step by step introduction how to compile KD Soap with the Symbian-Toolchain on Windows.

1. Open a command prompt.
2. Setup environment
   set QTDIR=c:\Qt\NokiaQtSDK_1_0_2\Symbian\SDK\
   set PATH=c:\Qt\NokiaQtSDK_1_0_2\Symbian\SDK\bin\;%PATH%
   set QMAKESPEC=symbian-abld
3. Chanhge to your KD Soap source-directory
   cd c:\src\kdsoap\
4. Run configuration
   configure.bat -shared -debug
5. Compile with
   make release-gcce
   make installer_sis
6. Depending on the Qt and Symbian^3 version you are using you maybe
   get an error like
   BLDMAKE ERROR: Can't find any RVCT installation.
   This is a known qmake@Symbian^3 bug. You can workaround that bug
   by installing python, saving following script in a file like e.g.
   c:\fix.py and executing that script using "c:\fix.py c:\src\kdsoap\"

import os, sys, re
for root, subFolders, files in os.walk(sys.argv[1]):
    for file in files:
        if file == 'bld.inf':
            path = os.path.join(root,file)
            i = open(path).read()
            o = open(path,"w")
            o.write( re.sub("WINSCW GCCE ARMV5 ARMV6","WINSCW GCCE",i) )
            o.close()

   This will replace in all generated bld.inf files the line
     WINSCW GCCE ARMV5 ARMV6
   with
     WINSCW GCCE
   to workaround that known qmake+Symbian^3 bug. 


6) Have a look at the examples applications. They will get you started with KD SOAP 1.x.

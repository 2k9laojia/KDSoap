General:
========
* Fix compilation with custom build systems who do not set include paths to QtCore and QtNetwork.
Similarly, do not requiring including the KDSoapClient and KDSoapServer subdirs, only the toplevel.

Client-side:
============
* Add support for return (output) headers (in async calls and jobs) (SOAP-45).
  Documented how to access them in sync calls (no deserialization possible).
* Fix namespace of the main element in messages being sent, the NS from the schema
  must be used rather than the NS from the WSDL, when both exist (github issue4).
* Fix assert when the response message is empty (github issue1).

Server-side:
============
* Implement support for HTTP Basic authentication, see KDSoapServerAuthInterface.
* Fix element name of the response element to be the one defined in the WSDL (SOAP-32).
* Added closeLogFile() so that log files can be rotated (SOAP-33).
* Support for HTTP GET requests for file download (SOAP-29_3).
* Support for SOAP requests on different paths than the default one (SOAP-8).
* Fix generated code when SOAP-1.1 and SOAP-1.2 bindings are present
  (fix compilation error, and set version to SOAP_1_2 in the 1.2 binding) (SOAP-44).
* Fix small memory leak if the device returned from processFileRequest can not be accessed (SOAP-48).
* Clean incoming path recieved via HTTP from "./" and "../" (SOAP-49).

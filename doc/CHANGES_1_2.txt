Client-side:
============
* Generic soapError() signal, for central processing of all SOAP errors (faults) [Jira SOAP-6]
* Fix support for the "short" and "unsignedShort" data types
* Apply end point configuration changes also if interface was already used
* Support for network cookies, see setCookieJar(). Requires Qt >= 4.7.0
* Generated code: make clientInterface() public.

Server-side:
============
* Support for delayed responses
* Fix support for messages with no input or output arguments
* Set response namespace automatically in generated processRequest, so as to not rely on the namespace
  of the incoming request.

Code generator changes, applying to both client and server side:
================================================================
* Handle wsdl files with multiple service definitions
* Reworked parsing of XML namespaces.
* New option -namespace <...> to kdwsdl2cpp, in order to put all the generated code into a C++ namespace.
* Better handling of whether elements are "qualified" or not, and writing out the correct namespace for them.

General:

Client-side:
============
*

Server-side:
============
* Rename request and response to _request and _response in order to avoid clashes
  with variable names coming from the WSDL.

* Add missing fwd decls for the args used in server methods.

* Fix parsing of Content-Type header to support spaces after ';' and double-quotes around the value
  (SOAP-112)

WSDL parser / code generator changes, applying to both client and server side:
================================================================
* Source incompatible change: methods that return an
  optional polymorphic type will now return a pointer instead of a
  const reference. Null references lead to crashes and therefore the change
  was unavoidable.

* Try harder to find a prefix for some namespaces.
  Important: this can rename some generated classes from __Class to PREFIX__Class.
  This source incompatible change was necessary to fix clashes between unprefixed
  classes coming from different namespaces, in some WSDL files.

* Parse namespace on portType correctly

* Fix infinite recursion when type A contains a member A with minoccurs=0

* Improve generated code so that it compiles without warnings when enabling -Wshadow

* Fix KDSoapJob return message deserializing in RPC mode.
  The generated code in the slot wasn't unwrapping the wrapper element.
  As a result the return object was all default-constructed, for lack
  of finding the right elements in the reply.

* Add missing builtin type xsd:QName.

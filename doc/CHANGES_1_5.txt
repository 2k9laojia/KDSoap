Client-side:

Server-side:
============
* Rename request and response to _request and _response in order to avoid clashes
  with variable names coming from the WSDL.

* Add missing fwd decls for the args used in server methods.

WSDL parser / code generator changes, applying to both client and server side:
================================================================
* Try harder to find a prefix for some namespaces.
  Important: this can rename some generated classes from __Class to PREFIX__Class.
  This source incompatible change was necessary to fix clashes between unprefixed
  classes coming from different namespaces, in some WSDL files.

* Parse namespace on portType correctly

* Fix infinite recursion when type A contains a member A with minoccurs=0
